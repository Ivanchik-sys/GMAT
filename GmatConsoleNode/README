Based on (but modified) http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html
look there for the latest version of instructions

DEPS:
Currently requires libGmatBase.so and libGmatConsole.so (custom make file rules) to be in the ./gmat_bind local directory.
Made changes to Gmat's ./src/console dir to create libGmatConsole.so.
Changed 
Gmat's "data" directory needs to be ../ from gmat_bind. (Room for improvement there).

You will need node-gyp
(to install globally run as root) npm -g install node-gyp

BUILD:
./make.sh will build everything for you.


TEST:
got to test directory and run "./test.sh"


TODO:
Allow web calls to the API and pass output back to clients.
Link to the API functions directly without needing to use GmatConsole.so
...much more
